In preparation of real repositories


Hi everyone

Well this is my first git commit on the 12th of March 2019

I currently reside in Cape town, originally from the Eastern Cape Engcobo. 

Well as you would've guessed i am an aspiring software developer.

The only difference is that i have been trying to do this ever since the age of 20

Ive been corresponding with the University of South Africa studying IT for the past 5 years

I am now 30 years old and stil i dont have something tangible i can show for.

But its okay, my life, my failures, stuff happens
